--- Bloc 107 [02:05:59 - 02:06:39] ---
said is that he hates a wasted life so some of us who W strongly influenced by him decided that let us offer to young men and young women an inspiration let us offer to young men and young women Hope vision a goal something to leave for excellence professor for in his time when there were no computers produced

Steps Ahead cl for professor et au moment où on luina ce diplôme de doctor of science il il était le deuxème africain à avoir ce diplôme c'est-à-dire tout l'ensemble de son travail académique a été évalué par des professeurs à Oxford University Durham et ils ont décidé que cet homme a apporté une contribution significative à l'avancement de la science mais qu'est-ce qui le distingue en tant que enseignant pour les hommes au moment de son départ il avait déjà formé s étudiants en thè qui était des tésard çaàd des docteurs j'étais un de ses étudiants le professeur Jam était un DEES étudiants et a un certain nombre et aujourd'hui vous allez suivre l'enfant de un de ces étudiants qui l'a formé qui est devenu professeur aussi de chimie c'est ça que nous voulons nous voulons offrir à cette jeunesse c'est ça qui est l'essence du cri qui était dans le cœur du prophesseur influencer des jeunes hommes et des jeunes femmes à devenir des hommes qui vont influencer le monde des grandes hommes c'est pour ça que nous sommes ici c'est l'expression la continuation la maturation et la substanation de cette vision l'excellence académique que le professeur F m'a poursuivu et nous avons conçu ce programme pour vous donner tout ce que nous considérions comme étant la racine du succès personnel et de ceux qui l'a formé et pour finir le professeur fou a laissé certains de nous avec un rêve je suis en train de travailler en chimie pour devenir le premier prix Nobel africain en chimie c'est mon but

academicvision she has a of experience that she wants to share with us ladies and gentlemen she's crafted she knows when we come to when it comes to computer science so in a Twinkle of an eye we are going to welcome Dr an Josi can you cl for her ladies and gentlemen I she doesn't speak Aart hi everyone bonjour t thank you for the introduction it's a great pleasure and honor for me to be able to stand in front of you today to share with you my academic journey and give you a glimpse of my research activities as he said I think I'm one of the first female presenter of the day so I want to give a special encouragement to female students and tell you that girls a place excellence um the slides please so today I will be talking about mobile human behavior their availability the leveraging and addressing the related privacy attacks but first I want to give a few adem journey i am I camer I did most of myudies here camer bal 10 years AG from the Lyang and after that iued my academics incole nationale suéur Polytechnique where I got a master of Science engineering computer science I had opportunitying my FTH year of engineering to pursue a research internship in France at the CNRS laboratory which allowed me to have a transition with the research world I did a PhD thesis Atle and EC Polytechnic in France and after that I moved to Germany where I am currently currently a postdctoral researcher working in machine learning mobile networks security and privacy can I have the slide please my talk of today will be in the context of mobile networks mobile networks are huge and I'm sure all of us are somehow familiar with the concept because we all most of us has a smartphone with a smart card uh Smart SIM card m networks tocnect as much as 5.7 milli of mobsbers around the this is huge because itesents around 70% of the world population and mobile and mobile networks allows or opens each of these mobile subscribers to a digital world with dissipation of geographical barrier because each user can communicate with another user the other end of the essibility to information and most important networking pervasiveness that is as we move we can connected and therefore still maintain this inter connection with the network and with the network users this pervasive connectivity is really important because it makes our real life and our Digital Life selessly mer together that means that our real human behavior dened by the rtinary activities we do throughout the day so we wake up at 7 am we prepare for going to work or to school we go there we work and then we go back to home and so on and so forth is reflected in this digital environment by the data we are generating throughout our routinary activities so to give a proper definition mobile human behavior is the data actively or passively exchanged through mobile networks that is reflective of our real human behavior a very nice example of such mobile human behavior is charging data records or shortly CDRs which are data collected passively by mobile operators such as orange or MTN as the network users are generating activity of the network surface so simply each time we make a call send an SMS or use mobile data there will be a new line recorded at the level of the mobile operator with the corresponding information so to say the estamp the type of event the phone number of the Col the phone number of the Col the related metric so the call duration the data volume and the position of the user who made the event at the granularity of the closes the nearest cell Tower which relate the call now I'm g to give a few words on the beauty and the beast of such type of data that are known as mobile human behavior so as already established we have mobile users maintaining a pervasive connectivity with the mobile networks that leads to the passive or active collection of mobile human behavior so for example CDRs the beauty is that the comprehensiveness of mobile human behavior gives the opportunity to leverage them in a plurality of domain so we made a study that show that in a five years period there were as much as 1,000 papers in the literature using s in one way or another and only a sample of 100 papers out of this 1,000 were applying CDRs data in as much as 14 different domains ranging from economics Mobile Security to transportations and so on so for instance leveraging CDRs we can have an automatic and complete population sensus because analyzing the records of users at n periods we can infer where they live exactly and similarly analyzing the records during the day we can infer the work location of a population at the range of the whole country but the beast is also very tied to that that is CDR data or mobile human behavior also contains sensitive details about the mobile users they are describing and we need to make sure that availability or access to this data is not privacy impeding so we need to give ways to have privacy preserving availability of CDR dataset and another side of this aspect is that as I said we are maintaining a pervasive connectivity with the mobile networks uh on which we have interaction with several parties not all of these parties are trustworthy they might be malicious actors we are connecting we are connected to in the network and we need to make sure that our data our private details our sensitive details are not accessed by malicious users so for instance we have applications a lot of applications on our smartphones we are exchanging messages and and pictures on social networks and somehow um studies have shown that they can be in an anomalous usage or access of these pictures that we are sharing because we are giving access to all our repertory of pictures and location that can be used maliciously by uh stakeholders on the web so these three as I will repeat privacy preserving availability leveraging and addressing the related privacy attacks are three perspectives that have shaped my past research and is still shaping my research um today and regarding privacy preserving availability we are propos solution for data generation instead of data release in which instead of releasing directly data holding sensitive details we want to leverage statistical simulation and deep learning generation methodologies to generate synthetic data that are still reflecting the distribution of real world data so we propose models that could capture the complexity of call detail records that are multivariate partially and temporarily irregular and heterogeneous because each user has a specific behavior and we need to capture this complexity so as conclusive remarks I will say that our society suffers from a lot of problem these problems are not only in our real world because I know we are more conscious of the real world problem but are also present in the digital world therefore we need to to be conscious and mindful that the problem in the digital world or our behavior with the digital our interaction with the digital world is real and can affect our real world and therefore I want to let you know students that you have a

Seigneur since the really important for us uh give me a few minutes to give you a summary in English was English speaking students and colleagues we started this discussion on the relevance of education for excellence two years ago we already define education at the process of receiving or giving systematic knowh but not only they know how they know how to be education is second after eradication of extreme poverty and hunger in the millennium development goals of the United Nations education therefore should not be limited to receiving or giving knowledge but should aim for the holistic development of an individual among the methods of education we already said that the approach the method where the teacher knows all transmit knowledge and evalu the evalu the capacity of the students to give what he has T is not relevant a few years ago another method came out and was applied in many Nations in this method the teacher is not supposed to know more than the student the teacher is not permitted to tell the student his thinking is wrong but last year after our work sessions with pastorod and we came to a formula and this formula we wanted to become a model that we can experience in our schools and in our universities this hybrid method says 30% theory and 70% practical now let's come back to the relevance of education for excellence the first point our first point our first recommendation is that we have to come back to real time holistic education the second thing we would like to say is that education has no value except that which can be gain from its application towards some useful or worthy end education is meaningful only when it is organized and applied for some use end a strong emphasis should be put on innovation creativity and discovery because I said professor used to say whatever the mind can conceive and believe can be achieved education system therefore should evaluate training programs modify them and adapt them to the needs of humanity in the CH World said that the only constant in the world is change the education system should not only prov solution for existingurent Humanity problems but also and above all to be should be proactive and anticipate the problems of the future I just said and very important to us men who have impacted the world have a wi range of vision either because they have the vision that vision themselves or because they know how to get it from some from another man who have seen what they can and we are in this second category we have received a great vision from professor for for excellence not only in the academies but in all works of life this great vision on education is drawn from the life of Professor for an educator and an academician for excellence whose work aims among other to provide educational and scientific solutions to human PL just one example professor formum has been able to characterize some compounds called pH estrogens these are nonst compounds that can bind to estrogen receptors he went far as to characterize some specific compound some comp specifically to the estrogen receptor beta sub unit and therefore can be a can be a treatment for neurological disorders we are inviting then you young men and young women in this generation to outside the box professor to be able to provide educational and scientific solutions to humans in order to alleviate the suffering of mankind during his on earth thank you for your kind
